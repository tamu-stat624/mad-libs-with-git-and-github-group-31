Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Siva,

I am writing to you from a gigantic spaceship in a spiral galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a blue rocket in August. There are 34 Dishes and Gates of Tree here! In the Conference Room there is a pool full of Rose water. I fall asleep each night on a soft bed of
Gold and dream of playing cards quickly. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
